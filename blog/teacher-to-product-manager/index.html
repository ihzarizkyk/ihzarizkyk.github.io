<p><strong>Achieve:</strong> Teachers help make the class comfortable and conducive, product managers help teams and companies achieve certain <strong>targets</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Teachers <strong>solve problems</strong> with students and solve them, <strong>product managers</strong> solve problems and create solutions with the team with existing resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Framework and formula:</strong> Teachers help students solve difficult <strong>problems with formulas</strong>. product managers solve problems with <strong>frameworks</strong> such as cohort analysis, MECE, RICE, north star metrics, scrum, tows matrix and others.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="fourth-understand-the-company-you-are-aiming-for-and-keep-updated-with-the-appropriate-industry"><strong>Fourth, Understand the company you are aiming for and keep updated with the appropriate industry</strong></h3>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a teacher and transitioning to product manager looking to get into an edtech company, make sure you know how the company works and what products they already have.</p>
<p><strong>In addition</strong>, learn about the industry you work in, and update the information through newspapers, seminars, product conferences, company reports and your own company analysis data.</p>
